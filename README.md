# TrincaUI
My personal layout for oUF with some extras. It's quite basic, but hopefully I will be adding to it little by little.

## Description
  * Minimalist and simple interface using oUF. All dependencies are embedded, so no need to install any extra addon.
  * Most of the code is taken from [ZorkUI](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info24252-ZorkUI.html), and also I took some tricks from oUF_Farva. Overall, my intent was to mimic my own configuration of AfenarUI, but using oUF instead of ElvUI.
  * This is currently work in progress, so functionalities may be missing and/or may never come. Testing comes from my own personal use, so hopefully it's enough.
  * All config is done in the config.lua file.

## Worthy additions
I'm personally using the following to complete the interface (you'll need at least Dominos and Aurora to get the look from the screenshots):
  * Dominos (you can find my profile [here](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info26207.html))
  * [Aurora](https://github.com/Gethe/Aurora)
  * [aBag](https://github.com/trincasidra/aBag-retail) or [AdiBags](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info25821-AdiBags-Shadowlands.html)
  * [My own](https://wago.io/p/Trincasidra%232868) weakauras or [Afenar](https://github.com/Afenar/AfenarUI)'s weakauras

## Other notes
